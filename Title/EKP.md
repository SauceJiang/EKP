## Enzyme Kinetic Parameter Prediction Project

### Introduction
- **Background**: Predicting enzyme kinetic parameters is a central problem in enzyme engineering, metabolic modeling, and biocatalyst discovery. In practice, experimentally measuring turnover number ($k_{\text{cat}}$), Michaelis constant ($K_m$), and inhibition constant ($K_i$) is costly and slow. Recent studies such as **CatPred** and **ERBA** show that multimodal learning can combine protein language models, substrate encodings, and structural information to improve prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization. These works build on curated benchmark datasets derived from **BRENDA** and **SABIO-RK**, and have made enzyme kinetics prediction a realistic machine learning project with publicly documented datasets, evaluation settings, and reproducible baselines.

- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Master the formulation of enzyme kinetics prediction as multimodal regression
  - Understand how to integrate protein sequence, substrate chemistry, and structural context
  - Learn how benchmark datasets are curated from biochemical databases
  - Compare sequence-only, sequence-substrate, and structure-aware learning methods

### Problem Statement
- **Technical Description**: Develop machine learning methods to predict enzyme kinetic parameters for a given enzyme-substrate pair, with optional use of active-site or full-protein structural information.
- **Mathematical Definition**:
  - **Stage 1: Enzyme-Substrate Representation Learning**
    - Input:
      - Enzyme sequence: $S_e \in \Sigma^n$
      - Substrate molecule: $S_m$
      - Optional structure/context: $S_g$
    - Encoded Outputs:
      - $H_e \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$: enzyme embedding
      - $H_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$: substrate embedding
      - $H_g \in \mathbb{R}^{g \times d}$: geometry/structure embedding
    - Learning Task: multimodal feature alignment and fusion
    - Example Objective Function:
      - $\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{repr}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{fusion}}$

  - **Stage 2: Kinetic Parameter Regression**
    - Input: fused representation $z = f(H_e, H_m, H_g)$
    - Output:
      - $\hat{y} \in \mathbb{R}^3 = [\log_{10}(k_{\text{cat}}), \log_{10}(K_m), \log_{10}(K_i)]$
      - or a single-endpoint regression target for one task
    - Learning Task: regression with optional heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation
    - Example Objective Function:
      - $\min_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(y, \hat{y}) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{uncertainty}}$
      - where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}$ can be MSE / MAE / Gaussian NLL
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Multi-source data integration across sequence, substrate, and structure
  - Sparse and noisy experimental measurements
  - Distribution shift across enzyme families and substrates
  - Limited structural coverage for some proteins
  - Fair benchmarking under sequence-disjoint or OOD splits
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - A reproducible enzyme kinetics prediction pipeline
  - Benchmark comparisons across sequence-only and multimodal models
  - Insight into when structural information improves prediction
  - A deployable inference workflow for prioritizing enzyme-substrate assays

### Data Description
- **Provided / Core Datasets**:
  - **CatPred benchmark datasets**:
    - $k_{\text{cat}}$: ~23k data points
    - $K_m$: ~41k data points
    - $K_i$: ~12k data points
  - **ERBA main datasets**:
    - Built on curated kinetic endpoint datasets derived from prior work and ultimately from **BRENDA** and **SABIO-RK**
  - **OOD evaluation datasets**:
    - EITLEM-based $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $K_m$ test sets for out-of-distribution evaluation
- **Additional Data Sources**:
  - **BRENDA** for experimentally measured enzyme kinetic records
  - **SABIO-RK** for curated reaction kinetics entries
  - **UniProt** for validated enzyme sequences and identifiers
  - **PubChem / KEGG / RDKit-derived canonical SMILES** for substrate standardization
  - **AlphaFold / ESMFold / OpenFold** structures for proteins lacking experimental structures
- **Variables**:
  - Enzyme amino acid sequence
  - Substrate name / canonical SMILES / molecular graph
  - Kinetic endpoint ($k_{\text{cat}}$, $K_m$, $K_i$)
  - Enzyme class (EC number)
  - Organism metadata
  - Optional 3D structure / active-site pocket descriptors
- **Sample Size**:
  - Main benchmark scale is approximately `23k + 41k + 12k` labeled examples across the three endpoints
  - OOD sets include tens of thousands of $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $K_m$ entries collected under stricter filtering
- **Dataset Availability**: `https://github.com/maranasgroup/CatPred-DB`

### Methodology
- **Suggested Methods**:
  - Protein language models (ESM2, ProtT5, Ankh) for sequence encoding
  - Molecular graph neural networks / fingerprints for substrate encoding
  - Structure-aware encoders for pocket geometry or residue graphs
  - Cross-attention or staged multimodal fusion (sequence → substrate → structure)
  - Uncertainty-aware regression heads (heteroscedastic Gaussian NLL)
  - Multi-task learning across $k_{\text{cat}}$, $K_m$, and $K_i$
- **Implementation Guidelines**:
  - Use canonical train/validation/test splits when available
  - Report sequence-identity-aware or OOD performance, not just random splits
  - Compare at least three model settings:
    - sequence-only
    - sequence + substrate
    - sequence + substrate + structure
  - Document all preprocessing decisions:
    - UniProt mapping
    - SMILES canonicalization
    - duplicate aggregation
    - missing-structure handling
  - Include uncertainty calibration or confidence ranking where possible

### Evaluation
- **Suggested Metrics**:
  - Regression Performance:
    - $R^2$
    - Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
    - Mean absolute error (MAE)
    - Root mean squared error (RMSE)
  - Robustness / Generalization:
    - OOD performance on dissimilar enzymes
    - Calibration under uncertainty estimates
    - EC-class-wise breakdown
- **Validation**:
  - Fixed train/validation/test split evaluation
  - Five-fold cross-validation if building a reduced teaching subset
  - Independent OOD test set evaluation
  - Ablation on structure usage and fusion order
